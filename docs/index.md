## ðŸ›  What is HexLang?

HexLang is a magical programming language where you write spells instead of code. You conjure variables, bind expressions, whisper to the void, and defy logic with chaos.

### Example:
```
conjure mana to 90
bind fury from mana + 10
whisper "Charging..."
if fury exceeds 95 then whisper "Spell cast!"
```
Output:
Charging...
Spell cast!

## ðŸš§ Work In Progress

This language is unstable, ridiculous, and full of bugs. Thatâ€™s the point.

Stay tuned.
