# ⬢ Hex Language

**Hex** is a programming language for humans who are tired of semicolons and want their code to sound like texting their smartest friend.

> You don’t write code. You *talk to it.*

## ✨ Example

```hex
let’s make a number called apples = 5
say "apples initialized"
ask the user for their name
if apples > 3, say "you got lots of apples!"
whenever you need to greet, say "hey there!"
greet now
```
## ❓ Why Hex?
- Reads like a damn conversation

- Makes coding less scary, more sassy

- Friendly, readable, teachable

- Zero punctuation anxiety™

🛠 How to Run
```
python hex.py path/to/yourfile.hex
```
## 📚 Learn the Language
