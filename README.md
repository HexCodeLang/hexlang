# 🍭 Hex Language

**Hex** is a programming language for humans who are tired of semicolons and want their code to sound like texting their smartest friend.

> You don’t write code. You *talk to it.*

## ✨ Example

```hex
let’s make a number called apples = 5
say "apples initialized"
ask the user for their name
if apples > 3, say "you got lots of apples!"
whenever you need to greet, say "hey there!"
greet now
```

## 🛠 How to Run

```bash
python hex.py examples/hello_world.hex
```

## 🚀 Roadmap

- [x] Variables, print, input
- [x] If statements & loops
- [x] One-line functions
- [ ] Multiline functions
- [ ] Arithmetic like “add 5 to apples”
- [ ] Web-based interpreter

## 📜 License

MIT or the **Do Whatever You Want** License. Hex doesn’t care.
