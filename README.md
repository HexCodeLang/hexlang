# 🧙‍♀️ HexLang

A spell-driven programming language for wizards, aliens, and the deeply unstable.  
Written in itself. Run by rituals. Powered by pure chaos.

> “The code does not compile. The code **summons**.”

## ✨ What is HexLang?

HexLang is a **declarative incantation language** that lets you write programs like spellbooks. It aims to be:
- **Readable like rituals**
- **Self-hosted** (eventually written in itself)
- **Minimal but expressive**
- **Weird as hell**

It’s currently bootstrapped in Python, but we’re building toward a fully self-hosted version and beyond.

## 📦 Example Ritual

```plaintext
conjure mana to 70
bind chaos from mana + 13
if chaos exceeds 80 then whisper "the ritual succeeds"

Output:

the ritual succeeds
