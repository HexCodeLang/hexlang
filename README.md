HEXLANG
=======

🧙‍♂️ The spell-based programming language for alien rituals, magical computation, and forbidden digital sorcery.

HexLang is a weird, arcane, minimal programming language designed to feel like casting spells on your computer. Variables are conjured. Functions are rituals. Output is whispered. It's not just a language — it's an ideology.

📜 Example Ritual
-----------------

conjure mana to 40
bind fury from mana + 66
if fury exceeds 100 then whisper "THE GATE OPENS"

🧠 Philosophy
-------------

HexLang is:

- **Arcane**: Syntax is magical, not mathematical. It reads like a ritual.
- **Minimal**: Tiny interpreter, dead simple execution model.
- **Bootstrapped**: We're building HexLang in HexLang. Yes, seriously. Self-hosting is the end goal.
- **Ridiculously readable**: You don't write code, you write spells.
- **Chaotic neutral**: Not meant for production. Meant for *power*.

🛠 Project Layout
-----------------
```md
hexlang/
├── hexlang_runtime.py      # The bootstrap interpreter (v0.1, written in Python)
├── specs/                  # Ritual test files written in .hex
├── docs/                   # (Coming soon) Grimoires, spellbooks, and theory

```
⚙️ Getting Started
-------------------

1. Clone the repo
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/hexlang.git
   cd hexlang
```
2. Run a ritual
```python
   python hexlang_runtime.py specs/demo.hex
```
3. Write your own spell
```hex
   conjure energy to 10
   bind output from energy * 2
   whisper output
```
💡 Language Primer
-------------------

- conjure <var> to <value>          — variable declaration
- bind <var> from <expression>      — assign a computed value
- whisper <thing>                   — print to stdout
- if <var> exceeds <num> then ...   — basic conditional

🧪 Coming Soon
--------------

- Loops (ritual cycles)
- Functions (custom rituals)
- Imports (summon other spell files)
- Compiler (eventually written in HexLang itself)
- Browser-based REPL and live spell editor
- Totally unnecessary and probably cursed AI integration

🔥 Contributing
----------------

Got a spell to share? Think the parser should summon demons instead of throwing errors? Want to help write the first self-hosting compiler? Open an issue, fork the repo, or just vibe.

We accept pull requests, pull demons, and pull chaos into the runtime.

📖 License
-----------

HexLang is released under the MIT License, because code wants to be free and so do the ancient ones.

🪦 Warning
----------

This language is experimental, incomplete, and borderline unholy. Use at your own risk. Side effects may include: terminal possession, stack overflows, runtime hauntings, and questions from your teacher.
